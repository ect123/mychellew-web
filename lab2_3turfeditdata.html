        Name: "Captain George Vancouver",
        YearOfInstallation: 1936,
        Status: "In place",
        DescriptionOfwork: "A full figure bronze statue of Captain George Vancouver stands on the north side of City Hall, pointing towards Vancouver harbour and holding a partially open scroll in his left hand. The figure commemorates the events of 1792, when Captain George, a representative of King George III of England, sailed into Burrard Inlet and charted the area.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.",

It depicts  the Gitksan mythical character Weget (Man-Raven), who created our world through his mischievous activities. The Gitksan people live near the Bulkley and Skeena Rivers in north central BC. According to a brochure published by the Royal Bank, the 3 central panels represent various myths: In one, Raven disguises himself in the skin of a deer in order to steal fire from the humans (shown as small faces in the lower corners). In the second story, Raven goes through a hole in the sky to steal the sun. The image depicts the sun (central to the panel) clutched in his claws over the box he put it in. As the story goes, he dropped the box in his haste and that's how light came to the world. Other creatures (salmon and seal) are depicted around his wings. In the third panel, Raven attempts to capture a fish to eat. As the fish struggles to get away, his head becomes misshapen and that's how the bullhead fish came to be. The side panels represent specific totem creatures: the frog, the wolf, the killer whale, the owl, the human and the bear.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "This 6'6\" bronze figure standing on a barrel is prominently located in Gastown and commemorates the man for whom Gastown is named. Born in 1830, \"Gassy\" Jack Deighton was an adventurer who went to sea and was attracted by the gold rush in California and then in New Caledonia (now British Columbia). He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much. (drawn from Old Vancouver Townsite Walking Tour, Footprints Community Art Project, 2001)",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The sculpture was commissioned by Larry Killam and others interested in improving business in the Gastown area in the early 1970s. Vern Simpson made the sculpture following a drawing by Fritz Jacobson. It was given as a Valentine's Day gift to the City.  Then Mayor Tom Campbell threatened to have it hauled away to the city dump.  Vandals later decapitated it but the head was returned for a $50 reward.",

Water wells up in the centre of the flower and spills out over the stylized petals, falling from between the serrated points into the pool below. The full flower is visible from the apartments above. The lotus form honours the history of Chinese immigrants and their contribution to the railway and the industries around False Creek. Three black granite circles are inset into the white concrete around the pool.  These rings echo the Ring Gear on Pacific Boulevard. Skateboarders like to practice on the flat surfaces around the pool. The area is finished with trees and simple black granite benches.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The project, for me, was about space for public use where art would help shape, animate and give meaning to that space.One of the underlying references is the many streams that once flowed into False Creek. The extension of the pavement above the water�s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.The pond�s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.As the pedestrian moves into the space the sound of the falling water becomes more dominant till the extraneous sounds of the street are entirely absorbed offering respite and perhaps an opportunity for further engagement and reflection.",

Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park.   In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. \"When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.\" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. \"Girl in Wetsuit\" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "\"I didn't believe we should have a copy of the mermaid (in Copenhagen harbour). She is rightfully a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there. At that time scuba diving was getting quite popular here in Vancouver and, just as important, I didn't know of any similar sculpture anywhere in the world. It was a new idea�  There was tremendous opposition and great controversy. I still don't know why..\"  (quoted in The Sculpture of Elek Imredy by Terry Nobel (publisher, Vancouver, 1993)  \"The sculpture (is) a symbolic figure of the future exploration of the continental shelf.\" (information provided by the artist)  \"She represents Vancouver's dependence on the sea and the necessity to use the sea for the benefit of all.\" - Peggy Imredy",

Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, \"These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.  Soon Vancouver will not have to propose dead sculptors to design memorials - there are and will be living and capable sculptors nearer home than on the other bank of the Styx..\" The original budget for the project was $50,000, but by the time Marega was commissioned in 1910, the project had become a bust for $4500, of which Marega was paid $3600 and the balance paid for an elaborate unveiling ceremony.

The crab represents the First Nations legend of the crab as the guardian of the harbour and was also the zodiac sign at the time of the Canadian Centennial.

        DescriptionOfwork: "The large steel sculpture is set on a 26' x 28' plaza of paving stones. The sculpture consists of a 15' square of corten steel. Each side of the square is 15' long by 3'  high by 3' wide. The bottom side appears to be cut apart in the middle and the two parts wrenched apart to form a gate or arch.  The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it \"a bloody monstrosity.\" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be \"the world's largest paper clip.\" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art \"intervention\". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the \"Gate to the Northwest Passage\" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek. The area around the site is a favorite for kite flyers.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The parameters for the juried competition operated by Parks Canada were to create \"a monument in Vanier Park to commemorate Captain George Vancouver,\" the first European to sail into Burrard Inlet, in 1792. The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, \"not wood,\" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, \"The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast.\" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice. Gordon Smith, a member of the selection panel, said that \"If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.\"  It was originally to be sited at Ferguson Point in Stanley Park.",

While I wished to contrast with the building's weight and greyness, and to amplify the theme of living growth represented in the tree plantings in the west half of the lobby, I also wanted the mural to be more than an appropriate decorative design. I wanted some image capable of appealing to the imagination of those who would use the lobby every day so that they would not tire of it and therefore become oblivious to it. What better than a great \" primavera \" for Spring to cheer the spirit? And what more impressive than a large sculptural relief in full colour? And what more poetically exuberant as a permanent symbol than two splendid butterflies breaking from the white cocoon of Spring - the one on the left an abstraction of pieces coming together to form the insect and the one on the right a full-fledged realization? It is hoped that once the mind is focussed in this direction a certain transformational process is suggested and with it certain mythological overtones might unfold. The cocoon may then become the violet and white mythic egg from which Spring is born. The symbolic bird and flowers now become the guardians of this ritual birth of new life, this PRIMAVERA.",

By age 18 he became the first man to hold the record in both the 100 yard and the 100 metre runs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he and his sister and their friend Paul Winn were the only black athletes in track in the Canadian National Championships. He ran in three Olympic competitions. In the 1960 Rome Olympics he collapsed on the track with a severely torn hamstring and was labeled a \"quitter\" by the press. He set another world record in 1962 but later had another fall when his left quadricep muscle group was completely severed.  After surgery and recovery he went on to win the Bronze medal in the 100 metre race at the Tokyo Olympics. Before his retirement in 1968 at 28, he established six world records. He was named BC's Athlete of the Century.  Afterwards he created manuals and sports programs for young people. He received the Order of Canada in 1972 and died suddenly at age 42 in 1982.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "The monument consists of a 100' diameter circle of 14 pink granite benches each 5.5' long with a slight bowl in the top.  Each bench is inscribed with the name of one of the 14 women killed by a gunman on December 6th, 1989, at the l'Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal.  The benches are about the length and width of a woman's body and the depression in the center of each bench catches rain water, a reference to tears. A 98' diameter circle outside the benches is set w/ 500 7�\" square tiles with the names of donors.The circle is situated close to the center of the park and makes reference to ancient stone circles. The space inside the circle is slightly domed and covered with grass. An alter-like podium stands just outside the circles and bears the name of the piece and an inscription. Over time, Marker of Change has quietly asserted itself into the consciousness of the community and has become a site for individual reflection and meditation as well as a place of discovery.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: " It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, \"The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance.\" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  \"The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.\"  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to \"all women who have been murdered by men\".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, \"Marker of Change\" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.",

The figure was sited at English Bay after the fair. The stones were brought in from a quarry in the Fraser Valley and then shaped and stacked by crane and pinned together with rebar. Inukshuks in the north are usually much smaller and the rocks are balanced on each other.  They act as sign posts or distance markers that can be seen on the flat horizon. Artist Kanak said,  \"By a lake an Inukshuk means lots of fish.\"  The figure is a \"reminder of the ingenuity of my people in addressing transportation and communications challenges prior to the introduction of modern technology.\" (sources: M.Farrow, V.Sun, April 24, 1985; V.Province, May 5, 1985)",

The design of the rocket ship looks like a 1950s Hollywood movie space ship. The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.The City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "A library is an ordered resource for accessing information to further one's knowledge and to enhance one's learning. The route taken to that information can guide the thought process and determine the end conclusions. Leonardo realized this a few centuries ago; Our concept is to challenge users of the facility to rethink their thought processes. The most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door.The format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth.In locating the piece at, and as the entrance, it emphasizes Public Art as a functioning componenet of life and architecture - the concept challenging one's thought process and the physical statement aiding in the flow and function of the ordered architecture.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "\"In reference to the library, the theme can be read as fragments which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a larger picture much as one accesses the library in quest of materials to fit in gaps of knowledge or time.The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in \"Technics and Civilization\" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the \"ruins\" of a clock face. Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars. This notion of \"mutable reality\" is a familiar theme in my work, which seeks to explore the boundaries of realism and representation:  Time... History... Motion... Imagination... Reflection�",

The artworks, like the larger project, are intended to draw attention to the habitat, plantlife, streambeds, and other important aspects of Trout Lake and John Hendry Park. Each artwork was conceptualized and created through a collaborative process with intensive involvement of the community surrounding the Trout Lake area. Through tours, workshops, Open House events and community meetings, members of the community became involved in the conceptualization and actual creation of the artworks. For the Pathways Project, workshops were held over a four week period in which students and members of the community created images with naturally coloured stones. The images were then grouted and set permanently into the ground around the lake.  Van Tech students participated.Anne Marie Slater was the coordinator and Paula Jardine was the coordinating artist for the entire Mapping the Future of Trout Lake project.",

Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions.

        DescriptionOfwork: "Mosaic Creek is a large mosaic in the shape of a creek made up of approximately 260 individual mosaics, each made by an individual or group of individuals. There are 3 separate sections of mosaic tile: the largest is approx. 80' long and varies in width and shape, the other two sections are approx. 10' long and 2 to 2.5' wide. The mosaics, set on a concrete base, are flush with the ground and flat across the surface, symbolically representing the surface of water. The park also includes a herb garden with a mosaic border designed by Glen Andersen and Marina Szijarto and wooden benches and a basalt pillar play area designed by Sarah White.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The idea for this project came from the initial public design process for the park itself. (A group called Britiannia Neighbours formed to organize a public design process and to fundraise for the park.) During the design process there were a number of ideas related ot water, none of which turned out to be feasible. Therefore, a symbolic representation was proposed - a mosaic creek. The intent was to involve as many community members as possible in making an art project which whould symbolize the notion of contributing one's individual expression and at the same time being part of a larger whole. There was no official theme or requirements except material specifications, I.e., frost-proof tile, type of glue, and spacing of tiles for grout allowance during installation. Approx. 500 people participated in the project (over 4,000 volunteer hours!).",

A series of workshops resulted in the production of individual works and a mural located at the Living Room Drop-In Centre.Throughout the summer of 1995, community members were given the opportunity to undertake art projects at their own pace and following their own vision. The Living Room mural, which is composed of over 300 individual pieces of art, provides a permanent public record of this process. An exhibition of works by downtown eastside residents was held at the exhibitions space The Atrium at 885 West Georgia.",

Hastings Park is at the base of the Hastings Street slope and in the middle of the Hastings community.  A grass slope provides a natural sunny amphitheater from which parents and supervisors can oversee the activities in the water park.  It was proposed that the slope be modified slightly and retained by a low 2' high concrete wall.  The surface treatment of the face of this retaining wall provided a prime opportunity for the integration of a community public art piece.  Water will be flowing out of the wall while the park is operating.  The artwork will add interest and animation to the play area during both on and off season months.  The artwork takes the form of a colourful file mosaic applied to the surface of the wall and could also incorporate metal inlays (eg. Brass, bronze, or copper to compliment and coordinate with the water spray heads).  The design of the artwork and the design of the waterplay area happened simultaneously to ensure the production an appropriate piece, unique to this particular site. - Park Board web site",

Walter raises questions related to the systems underlying the transactions and power-plays that constitute normal business in the world of real estate development. In Walter's art the museum without walls is also a museum OF walls, walls  new and old, as well as those walls that perpetuate economic class distinctions.  Her text on the fa�ade of the Del-Mar Hotel will stand as a witness to the various power-plays, including the threat to move B.C. Hydro's head office to the suburb of Burnaby, that led to the development surrounding 553-555 Hamilton Street.\" - from \"The Interventions of Kathryn Walter\" by Bill Jeffries, Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1990",

        DescriptionOfwork: "Integrated into the public walkway through the Lions Developement at 1300 West Georgia, is a plaza incorporating fibre optic lights, mosaic swirls, and 3 large bronze castings of cargo ships seen from above. The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     Kerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.The work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.\"Milky Way\" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the \"cosmic sea\". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. \"Milky Way\" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized \"site specific\" public art instead of traditional sculpture.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "\"By day, a swirling mosaic paints the night sky beneath our footsteps.  By night, the ground plane disappears; a dazzling array of starlight guides our way.  We walk like giants through a carpet of lights, our footsteps stir the universe.\" (From artists' proposal)\"�There are four main elements layered into the work. First, 40 tile mosaics spiral across the site in 16 brilliant colours. Each design has been abstracted from photo images of actual galaxies. Then clusters of stars are created by 160 fibre optic points of light set in granite tiles which in turn are joined by polished brass dashed lines to define familiar constellations. The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' \"cosmic sea.\" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).\" (From news release for public opening ceremony)",

Two centuries of activity are traced in time from left to right.\"  (information sheet from the Maritime Museum)   In the upper left, the \"Lions\" represent the geographic outlook of Vancouver. The activity on the sea is represented by images of First Nations peoples and their canoes and Captain George Vancouver and his ship Discovery along with Valdes and Galiano and their ships Sutil and Mexicana from 1792.The image also shows Captain GH Richards who surveyed the area and his ship Plumber as well as the Beaver, the first steamship on the coast, a Hudson Bay Company supply vessel, along with others. In the diamond in the centre of the image is the Empress of Japan and its famous dragon figurehead which is in the Museum's collection.  Modern freighters and luxury steamers complete this section of the picture. The Lions Gate Bridge, built in 1939, is depicted, as is the St Roch, the RCMP patrol vessel that worked the North-West Passage in the early 1940s, which is housed in the Maritime Museum. Also shown are the Ivanhoe and the Master, wood-hulled tugs from the early 20th century. The harbour is depicted by Canada Place with its cruise ship facility and the Saskatchewan Grain Pool elevator and a Japanese freighter. The people who work in the harbour are also shown, identifiably Joe Fortes, the legendary English Bay lifeguard.

The granite shall be set in an east/west linear pattern, except for an inner oval directly under the artwork that will be cut and set in a specific pattern corresponding to the delineation of the elements of the piece.  The structure of the artwork is a series of 10\"x10\"x60' steel columns that are arranged in such a way as to delineate a scaled down relationship to the 5 elevator shafts in the core of the building. The 5 elevator cars are represented in their respective positions on the columns. An interface with the actual elevator system in the building will cause the artwork cars to glide up and down the columns in exact co-relation to the real cars, ie, if only elevator #2 is used, and it is taken to the 16th floor, the artwork will respond accordingly, while the remaining cars stay idle.  Next, in each car in the building, placed under the pumpkin coloured carpet, will be a multi-contact membrane switch that will pick up the various passengers' foot prints as they stand or walk in the car, and transmit them out to an LED matrix screen on the underside of each corresponding artwork car.

A number of groups participated including Youth Against Violence, Purple Thistle Youth, Trout Lake Seniors, Eastside Alternative School and Fort Good Hope, and the NWT youth organization in Vancouver on an exchange program. The artists worked with participants to design the mosaics and they did the tile work.

Parker picked Ogopogo to represent his dad's upbringing in Vernon. Conner picked Dolphins to represent our feeling of coming from the ocean. Melida picked the Quetzal to represent her family's Latin heritage.  We translated our political words 'Community, Struggle, and Freedom into Spanish, as well as to tie the two heritages together.\"  \"Community by Nancy Sweedler and Allyson Prendergast:  My mosaic circle represents what dominates my physical space and heart.

        DescriptionOfwork: "Time Top is a piece about time travelling. The artist has created what looks like a 1940s-style space ship. The piece was submerged for two years so that the surface would become encrusted with sea life. The sculpture was given a low-level electrical charge to attract crustaceans to its surface. Its position on the shoreline encourages the idea that it has washed up from the depths. For more information, cut and paste the following website address : http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/oca/publicart/webprojects/pdf/timetoppressrelease.pdf",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "\"The inspiration for Time Top came from a comic strip by William Ritt and Clarence Gray called The Time Top that the artist read as a child. In it�s last episode, the Time Top was slowing down over the ocean . . . And the artist has picked up the story line from there and is presenting this sculpture as �a relic of reality, building on the idea of an alternative reality which we each share with a broad diversity. � A comic book describing the artist�s creative and fabrication processes will be published to coincide with the opening event scheduled for early October 2006.After being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to it�s surface forming a crust. This process is known as �Electro-deposition of minerals in seawater� or accretion. When the accretion process was complete,the sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture. The sculpture fabrication was completed after the artist�s death in 2003 by a team led by Margaret Pethick, Jerry�s wife, according to his fully documented drawings, specifications and nstructions.\" - press release, Maureen Smith, Concord Pacific, August 2006",

Copper map installations can be seen at Kitsilano Beach just south of the playground; Volunteer Park at Point Grey Road; at the foot of Bayswater, and at Jericho Beach approx. 100 m. west of the concession.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "This project was the result of a long process of researching and photographing the local landscape and consultation with members of the community, Park Board and the School Board. The work consists of 16 in-ground and 4 above ground markers installed along the routes of four historical streams that once existed in Kitsilano. Each of the in-ground markers has the words LOST STREAM engraved around the outer edge. Each marker also contains engraved words on two themes; first, along the edges, two-word phrases for the agents of the demise of the stream e.g. \"Logging railway\" and second, in the centre, four kinds of plant and animal life that have disappeared e.g. \"sockeye, thimbleberry, lynx and fir\". Artist Marian Penner Bancroft writes, \"...my desire became to find a way of recalling what was now invisible, of marking the routes of the streams and in doing so to call up an earlier image of this place, to bring some history into the present... I also installed at (Kitsilano) Community Centre a set of black and white photographs, two for each (stream) path.

The first installation of the community�s vision was the Duchess Walkway and involved community members and park goers in all stages of the design and implementation. The Duchess Walkway includes a series of pebble mosaics (created by community members with local artist, Jennifer Norquist) and the Guardian Spirit (a totem pole carved with local carver, Jerry Sheena and youth from the neighbourhood who learned to carve from this experience). The Constellation Lanterns were the final stage of the Duchess Walkway and are made with cut out designs by local community members and artists.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "The Strathcona Pavilion links community processes and art making to Vancouver�s Public Art Program. In 2004 a collaborative process between myself, Architect David Rose and the Strathcona Park Committee was begun to build a Pavilion in Strathcona Park that would celebrate the lives of the people living in the area. The new structure would feature artworks created by community members generated through a process that spanned half of the following year. Through the fall of 2004 and winter 2005 workshops were held to make paper cut designs that would then be translated into the cut wood and cut metal designs, which now adorn the Pavilion. Paper cutting has many traditions in many cultures and it was an interesting process, which captured people�s imaginations and engaged all ages in the Strathcona neighbourhood. Artworks were created by children, parents, families and neighbours at Strathcona School, Seymore School, Strathcona Community Centre, Raycam Community Centre, The Core Artist Co-op, and through gatherings at people�s homes. Altogether there are over 200 individual designs on the Pavilion.The Pavilion and artworks were completed in July 2005 and a community celebration was held in the park.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "These three beautifully carved red cedar portals are constructed to represent the traditional slant-roof style of Coast Salish architecture with carved welcome figures in the doorways. They are intended as a gesture of welcome to the traditional lands of the Coast Salish people of the area. The artworks reflect the history of these aboriginal people as well as the modern culture that still thrives. Three years in the making, the artworks were developed through collaboration with Coast Salish Arts; Vancouver Storyscapes (a City of Vancouver Social Planning project to encourage aboriginal people to share their stories through a variety of media); the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Watuth First Nations; and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation.",

Both figures wear Salish blankets incorporating weaving designs and a salmon motif. On the reverse side, the male has traditional design elements and the female has a motif influenced by Salish berry basket designs.                                                                                            2) Grandparents and Grandchildren Honoured - On the upright poles located southwest of the path an intertwined braid of hair links the three female faces of the grandparents pole, illustrating the powerful matrilineal ancestry of the Coast Salish. The abstract design on the back represents the salmon, once so plentiful in the area. The grandchildren pole pays tribute to the importance of the family bond. On the reverse side, a carved herring design reflects the living culture in the area as it has been transformed through history.                                                                                              3) Salish Dancer and Killer Whale - Visible from the seawall and park drive north, the third portal articulates the evolution of Salish design. A Coast Salish Dancer shows a human figure holding a sea serpent rattle and above it, the Thunderbird, the most powerful of all spirits and a symbol of protection. On the opposite face of the Dancer, tree roots connect us to the land, sea and sky.  The Killer Whale upright depicts five whales, each with a raven fin and salmon pectoral, representing the close link between humans and orcas. The Salish believe that when great chiefs die, they become killer whales. The crossbeam is carved with a Salish textile motif.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "Copper sculpture of the artist as the philosopher, Erasmus, seated backwards on a horse reading a book.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham�s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to �ponder on horseback�  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham�s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer�s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a �treasure island�, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist�s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that �the trip is the thing�.(Rodney Graham in conversation with Iwona Blazwick, Director, Whitechapel Gallery, October 14th 20082 Rodney Graham in Rodney Graham, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 2002 p.109)",

The intention was to create an iconic sculpture acting as a gateway marker defining the entrance to the City of Vancouver. turn acts as an identifier of place, creating an image in the viewer�s mind that connects them back to the site. The imagery and form for turn evolved from ideas about �driving� and �fixing� in particular, with the final form of the sculpture column based upon the twist drill.

        DescriptionOfwork: "Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community College�s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College�s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing �insight� into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360� view of the surrounding space.Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation�s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don�t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation�s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.",

His piece for the Georgia Street entrance to Stanley Park, a spectacular 400-hectare evergreen oasis in the downtown peninsula, is a 35 foot abstract stainless steel sculpture that replicates a balsa wood toy glider set; abstractly assembled as a modern sculpture. The work includes an impression of the twisted blue elastic band that would be used to power the glider, a propeller that slowly turns in the wind and wheels that whimsically bob.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The work takes its title from a series of photographs I shot in Vancouver in 1977�which documented a series of �incorrectly� assembled toy glider kits�I put the models together not with a view to having them fly correctly, but with an eye to their aesthetic value as purely abstract sculptural forms� Part of the challenge inherent in making these works was the very limited instrumental set from which I had to draw.When I was asked to create a sculptural proposal for the entrance to Stanley Park, it occurred to me that it might be interesting to return to this work�and try to realize a large-scale version of one of these sculptures: to use the same very limited instrumental set with which anyone who has put together a toy glider would be familiar. The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.And the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with gliders� Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.The title of the work is meant to evoke, in a slightly humorous way�that of a classical modernist public monument of a bygone period, elements of which the sculpture plays with.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "THE WORDS DON�T FIT THE PICTURE is a text-based work made in response to the context, building and public surrounds of the Vancouver Public Library. The work takes the form of a large freestanding sign that sits in front of the VPL just off the southern entrance of the building in a heavy pedestrian traffic area. The sign takes its cues from an era of signage when signs were once seen as celebratory, grand and iconic � in effect, as landmarks in their own right as a kind of symbolic architecture (think: Caesars Palace, The Flamingo, The Stardust � to the landmark of all landmarks, Hollywood). In tracing this lineage, the work also acknowledges a local history when Vancouver was once seen as one of the neon-light capitals of North America. Reminders of this once past persists in signs like BOW-MAC �on Broadway� (now retro-fitted with the Toys R� Us sign) and of course the W atop of what once was the Woodward�s building. In adopting the form of a sign, THE WORDS DON�T FIT THE PICTURE elides the classifications of traditional sculpture, by evoking a typology that is at once familiar and accessible. Taken within the context of a public library, the work touches upon � in a very poetic way � the use of words and language as boundless and imaginative, as a catalyst for a multiplicity of meanings.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Beneath a long, dark Canadian winter, Vancouver will be a hive of activity during the 2010 Olympic Games. As a way of brightening the nights, adding to the sense of excitement and making the City visually remarkable, we developed three artistic lighting schemes for the City�s downtown core and Cambie Street.Fireworks Boulevard, a series of sequenced LED fireworks, chases down Cambie Street, transforming it into a grand entrance boulevard to the City. Vivid and unequivocally joyful, one can imagine watching the street lighting against a sky filled with actual fireworks.[Downtown] will be marked with a path of blue LED lights, which will feature animated rain sequences. In Yaletown, these cool-toned LED rain barrels will be complemented by a series of warm coloured flickering LED flames. The flames atop the lampposts will bring a touch of the Olympic Torch from BC Place Stadium, where it will be housed, outside to the city streets. Flickering candle-like flames will also provide a sense of warmth for the cold winter evenings and recall a time when gaslight was used to illuminate the streets of Yaletown.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "My pieces are about concerns which play an important role in everyday life as well as in art, in painting, sculpture, architecture: space�movement�time�light. My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place�the situation�the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light�daylight and artificial light�exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it. I am very interested in all these special qualities.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "Flow is Vancouver's first photo/media-based permanent public art work. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over the last few years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material (switch glass). As viewers come close to the image, this material causes portions of the imagery to disappear as panels of it's surface switch from translucent to clear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they simultaneously present, with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they're part of a larger narrative. The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream like or hallucinatory quality. Because the project system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow's dynamic glass projection surface ceates viewing portals, framing details the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street(these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby to view activity going on inside the building.The online component of Flow allows viewers to see the work unfold during the day when the site image projectors are off and the site glass is the active component. Visitors are encouraged to engage with the work by clicking on the \"Put words in our mouths\" link to play with dialogue and attribute phrases tocharacters pictured within the work. This collection of phrases is dynamic and will be added to over time. After choosing the phrase(s), the scene still can be saved and added to the Flow archive.",

The Salmon represent resilience, as well as hope for sustainability. The Woman and the Child represent what we are holding onto, and what we are reaching for: hope and life. The visual stories represented in this mural weave themselves into the many culturally diverse groups of neighbors and what we all share in our daily lives, and a hope for those who view it daily to be lifted up during their work at the garden or their daily commute, or even just their walk in the hood.�",

The steel fence, with its grids and rivets that delineate the eyes, mouths and fins of the whales and the salmon, represents a type of vessel similar to the ships that anchor at Port Metro Vancouver�the destination of the majority of the trucks driving along the street below the artwork. The sculpture depicts two sets of stylized whales facing opposite directions with their tale flukes meeting in the centre. The whales pursue salmon cascading down the slope towards the North Shore mountains.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects sea levels rising between four and six metres as a result of the partial melting of the earth's major ice sheets. False Creek, which once extended as far as Clark Drive before massive infill projects altered its shape, is a site that provides an opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Vancouver's highly managed shoreline. \"A False Creek\" marks the midpoint of these IPCC sea rise estimates (five metres), with painted chromatic blue stripes on the pilings of the Cambie Bridge, and on the lampposts near Cooper's Park. This abstract pattern of stripes inevitably produces a decorative effect, one with an ambiguous relation to the pattern's function as a marker and visualization tool. The work points to the potential and problems of such tools. The scale of the engineering of False Creek and the Cambie bridge, along with the scale of potential future environmental change, are made visually and physically palpable, yet the experience takes on an aesthetic related to philosophical concepts of the sublime.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "There have long been rumours of underground water at the Hillcrest site, but Hillcrest Geyser arises from other hidden sources and pressures � the infrastructure of the new �green� water recycling system in the building. This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earth�s surface. A natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic �natural wonder� that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building�s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city�s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water �loop\" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Because its eruptions are unpredictable and seemingly random, the artists believe the geyser will cultivate a sense of wonderment and play, attaining a reputation less like that of a civic monument and more like a mysterious element of the natural world.",

This second trolley also featured three thematically related interior cards in which knit figures act as the dramatis personae.\"Memento � Multo\", inside a third trolley, featured a set of twenty-two interior cards depicting over 100 different examples of the modest but culturally and aesthetically interesting objects that can be found in shops along Main�s 88 Blocks.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Memento is a response to the material culture that contributes so strongly to the character of Main Street. Main Street is more typically characterized by the presence of a multitude of objects that tend to have a personal meaning and relate to everyday life rather than high-end consumption. The poodle was chosen as a motif for the sculpture and other artworks in Memento because it is expressive of the general surroundings of the street. The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place. The sculpture is based on and is a representation not of a living poodle, but rather of a porcelain figurine, the kind of object that might be found in any number of shops along Main Street.",

Made of wood and metal and resembling the benches in Vancouver's bus shelters, the artwork is located in close proximity to an existing transit shelter with an integral bench making the visual references clear.A transit bench as teeter-totter creates a playful situation full of possibilities for interaction and negotiation. Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28\" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses.

        DescriptionOfwork: "This mural is one of the City's Year of Reconciliation Projects, and is based on the cultural links and connectivity of Aboriginal, Chinese and Japanese cultures. The convergence of these groups is protrayed in a woven design with symbols, narratives and text from each culture. The mural was conceived with input from each of the three communities, and incorporated into the final design. The mural includes many unifying elements including a large wave suggesting constancy, adaptability, humans' relationship to nature and connectivity to roots and language. Artists Eri Ishii, Richard Tetrault, Jerry Whitehead and June Yun worked with mentored youth from each cultural group on the painting of the mural.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Four paddles of Salish design, represent the four directions, and contain images of Salish serpents, and other glyph forms. The tops of the largest paddle is in flames, alluding to the great fire of Vancouver in 1886, an event that left many from the early city trapped on the shores of the Burrard Inlet. Indians of the Coast Salish Squamish arrived in their dugout canoes to rescue people, sheltering them in their nearby village church. The poem that was sung as they paddled the inlet is inscribed on the bow of the canoe. The movement of the paddles is echoed in vertical bamboo along the left side, superimposed with the Hanji character meaning 'Harmony\" and aims to emphasize the collaborative nature of this project as well as the unique characteristic of the Downtown Eastside where several cultures co-exist in harmony.",

The Musqueam people have lived on their traditional territory � the land and waters now known as the lower mainland of BC encompassing the greater Vancouver region � for several thousands of years.  One of Musqueam�s most sacred sites, the Great Fraser Midden, is located just south of this site.The sculpture was conceived by the artist to acknowledge this rich cultural history, the history of the Coast Salish people, and to (re)introduce the residents of this community to their neighbour ~ the Musqueam people.The 14� high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "�Fusion� is an artwork that marries mediums and cultures�as well as legends.  It also, metaphorically, fuses natural imagery with modern methods.The sculpture is contemporary yet unmistakably Salish.  As this development sits in traditional Musqueam territory and is close to the banks of the Fraser River, my conceptual art piece is based on the theme of �people of the Grass� as well as the �Salmon People� which is uniquely Musqueam.  The human element within the salmon has universal appeal that symbolically relates to all peoples.  The faces are revealed with traditional Salish elements.  Overall, the forms represent a living thriving culture and our historical legacy; as well as this unique community today�giving a sense of place and a landmark that respects the past, present and future.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely adecoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver�s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion�s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvioussomething else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?Substation Pavilion�s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of �reclaiming� the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus thatcontains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once ayear with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.Cedric BomfordOctober, 2014",

Designed by brother and sister team, artists Thom and Kelly Cannell, the panels tell a contemporary tale about their homeland, and depict creatures of the Land (green) and the Sea (blue).  Each light box is shaped as a fragment of a circle,  the shape of a spindle whorl which was utilized when spinning the yarn used in Coast Salish weaving.  (Examples of Musqueam weaving can be seen in the display case in front of the Safeway store along Granville street).  Creations in weaving have been passed down for countless generations.  The artists� grandmother, Edna Grant, was taught to weave by her mother, who was taught by her mother, and so on. Her designs could be recognized up and down the coast.  Not unlike a crest, weaving designs symbolize lineage.  This is true in carving, weaving, painting, and dancing.  The artists are proud of this legacy and acknowledge it in this artwork.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "\"Land is usually depicted as steady and stable, Sea as unpredictable, and Sky as free spirited.\" Our account of Land and Sea is a contemporary tale about our homeland. Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle�s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements. Only when we see the whole picture together will the circle be complete. Our home is to inspire people to look closer in order to understand the subtleties and multitude of factors involved in our world.",

The sculpture serves as a structure to facilitate urban agriculture activity. The deconstructed barn provides all of the required infrastructure in an optimized setting to grow food and plants for the residents of the LIDO development.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "At once romantic and fantastic, Nail Farm seeks to reconcile the desire to satisfy city-self and country-self, the inherent drive in urban agriculture. The barn is based on a local gambrel roof barn. It is abstracted to the point where it can be seen more as a lattice system to use for the growth of plants. The implied animal stalls become the grow beds. The entire footprint of the project is covered in 2' deep growing medium and can therefore be used as a ground forgrowing anything. Even the paths can potentially be overgrown. It is the aim of the project to provide a unified, total \"planter\" as an interesting alternative to the more typical community garden topology of segregated 'grow boxes'.",

Musqueam elders advised that the small juvenile tree planted in the center should be the highly revered western red cedar. Over the years, as the fungi breaks down the stacked wood recycling it into humus, the red cedar will flourish into a beautiful tree while the stone slabs (�petals�) will slowly open up like a flower.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Like Booth�s other wood and stone works such as Tranekaer Vader, 1998 and Zunderschwamm, 1999   nac???t??p �Transformation Plant� harnesses the great recycling ability of fungi to facilitate a very long term (30 +/- years) kinetic living earth art work.In doing these living works, it is one of the artist�s aims to highlight the wonders of fungi, the most extensive of all living organisms and one of our most ancient sources of food and medicine.  This ancient and generally lesser known plant-like organism is vital to all life on earth, yet is threatened by human activities.  The uncontrolled build-up of manmade greenhouse gas emissions is making our atmosphere inhospitable ? even toxic ? to life as we know it. The devastation caused by people is happening around us on an ever-increasing scale. Hopefully, these living earth art works will educate the visitor to be wiser � to become proactive in reversing this spiraling catastrophe.",

The artwork title �RGB� refers to the additive model of reproducing colours with light (red, green, and blue). The three colours can also be seen to symbolize the Trinity. A fritted glass pattern comprised of over 1,000 crosses on each large panel of glass are repeated across the windows of the church facility. Nine different intuitive arrangements of crosses, three arrangements for each of the three colours, create an overall, organic, swarming pattern. The architecture appears porous as light passes through the windows and the shadows of the crosses spill across the interior surfaces.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The simple unadorned cross was chosen to create a pattern in order to de-emphasize its form. With over one thousand crosses on each large panel of glass and approximately two hundred thousand crosses that cover the windows of the CPC, each individual cross becomes the building block or pixels that creates a larger whole. Along with the intuitive arrangements of the crosses, which create a contrast to the rigid grid of the building, these organic swarms of crosses seek to visually erode the architecture making it more porous, almost formless, allowing for a gentler interface with its surroundings.Similar to ambient music, with an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over structure and rhythm, �RGB� seeks to reflect the diversity and inclusiveness of the Central Presbyterian Church and the surrounding West End community.",

Four delicate lines of dichroic glass are integrated into the southeast and southwest facades to bring nuances of shifting colour to viewers. The hues are affected by climatic and light modulations in the sky. Like weather and emotion, all is in a constant state of change.

A glacial boulder was selected from the earth at the project site, and six replica �boulders� were cast from aluminum. WHERENESS provides a tactile link and landmark between the area�s geological past and its current situation. It is a visual puzzle to be examined and contemplated �in the round.� WHERENESS acknowledges an ancient human practice of piling rocks at certain points along pathways to guide travelers.

As 'play-sculptures' that combine modernist sculpture, mid-century playground designs, and monochrome patterns, these sensuous organic forms will invite a more physical engagement than is normally allowed with public art, providing occasions for children, families, and staff to play. The vision of the artists is to engage audiences of all ages and abilities with the sculptures' tactile qualities and lift their spirits with their humour and playfulness, creating a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary.Playtime is originally inspired by the 'play-sculptures' of English sculptor John Bridgeman (1916-2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon Moller-Nielsen (1915-1959), the work of Henry Moore, and two female artists, Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) and Bridget Riley (1931-present), all of whom were producing works around the same time.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Our vision for this public art project focused on the idea that 'playtime\" is itself a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary. Our goal was to develop a collection of works that the children, families, staff and general public could play with as part of the Wellness Walkway. Playtime encourages a more physical engagement with the work than is normally allowed with public art and was the core concept in the development of these works. Our hope is that what we have proposed will engage everybody through their tactile qualities and lift the spirits with their humour and playfulness.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxw�7mesh (Squamish) and x?m??k??y??m (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw�u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance. ",

The inside viewer (hospital community or patients and staff?) is/are able to examine objects in detail over a 35 foot, colour-changing walkway mural, while the public art viewer sees an expanded version as colour spectrums spanning up five floors.Culled from her collection of jewel-toned glass objects and augmented by flea market finds and borrowed treasures, this giant-sized still life creates a spectrum of colour that is projected into the building in the afternoon and glows at night in a building-sized lightbox. Like large photographic slides, the transparent panels are mounted to a series of glass walkways that make up one wall of the internal atrium. The murals transform the hallways with the changing light, allowing inside viewers to experience a �colour walk� as the sun projects the art into the building and onto the light colored floor.",

        DescriptionOfwork: "All my favorite people are Animals is a sliding door panel made of cast bronze that sits in front of a one?way mirror. The small area between the mirror and the door is lit during library opening hours.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPL?s new n???ca? ?mat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of �Head in the Hole� photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, n???ca? ?mat ct, loosely translates as �we are one� in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as �one� across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ?Head in hole? photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Excavations is a composite image made from numerous archival photographs of Vancouver, with the earliest images dating back to the 1880s. Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver�s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city�s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver�s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist�s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver�s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.",

In the Pender Street lobby, the undulating design follows from the tradition of Portuguese pavements. The pattern, executed in three contrasting colours of stone, extends beyond the lobby entrance and across the adjacent sidewalk to the curb.In the Old Stock Exchange building, the elaborate ceiling of the original elevator lobby features imagery based on the provincial coats of arms. In keeping with this heraldic theme, the design for the refurbished lobby floor illustrates the waves and rising sun that are emblems of British Columbia's flag.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Waft's wave-form patterns can be seen to celebrate Vancouver's identity as a coastal city. At the same time, I am interested in how the undulating forms will engage the viewer's senses. Perhaps they may serve to impart a measure of rhythm to the ambient space and, in doing so, act as counterpoint to the straight lines and right angles that predominate in the built environment.",

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan. The sign is an initiative of the Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce. (Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce, Dedication of the Welcome to Kitsilano Sign and Sculpture, June 20, 1998)",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Building A - Livestock Building is an infrared photograph of the 1929 Livestock Building located on the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of �all persons of Japanese racial origins,� from the west coast �protected area� of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled �enemy aliens,� were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners� consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children�s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men�s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process. This image portrays the interior of the Livestock Building, with bedsheets dividing the living quarters. The thermal photograph suggests a way of seeing what is no longer obvious or visible to us today.",
