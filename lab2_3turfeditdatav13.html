        DescriptionOfwork: "This 6'6\" bronze figure standing on a barrel is prominently located in Gastown and commemorates the man for whom Gastown is named. Born in 1830, \"Gassy\" Jack Deighton was an adventurer who went to sea and was attracted by the gold rush in California and then in New Caledonia (now British Columbia). He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much. (drawn from Old Vancouver Townsite Walking Tour, Footprints Community Art Project, 2001)",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The sculpture was commissioned by Larry Killam and others interested in improving business in the Gastown area in the early 1970s. Vern Simpson made the sculpture following a drawing by Fritz Jacobson. It was given as a Valentine's Day gift to the City.  Then Mayor Tom Campbell threatened to have it hauled away to the city dump.  Vandals later decapitated it but the head was returned for a $50 reward.",

The elliptical roof of each pavilion is supported by two walls made of stainless steel with cutout silhouettes of  industrial and natural forms. A second component of Lookout is a perimeter railing with cantilevered glass panels. The panels are inscribed with sandblasted words, written especially for this site in consultation with poet Robin Blaser. Midway between the two pavilions, the cut-out images are cast into the concrete walkway. As well, the artists have placed 13 simple bronze chairs throughout the site. The art work has an accompanying website at: http://www.lookoutsculpture.com/",

Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.",

I have quoted from the City Archives, C.P. Railway Archives, anthropologists and poets to find words to sandcarve into 57 blocks of unpolished black granite. Set into pavers, they are like markers on a path (of time), an echo.

It carried into the \"well\" of the sea the memories from earliest times. I am proposing a symbolic reclamation of the past and recognition of change. ... there will be three elements within this flowing river. From the \"source\" at the upper waters a 10 ton erratic glacial boulder will be positioned ... at the pool below will be its mirror image, in bronze altered by chemical reaction and time. Language is the third bridging element, for words to convey a sense of a river's journey I have used the following quote by Leonardo da Vinci: \"In rivers, the water you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes; so with time present.\"",

Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions.

The mosaics, set on a concrete base, are flush with the ground and flat across the surface, symbolically representing the surface of water. The park also includes a herb garden with a mosaic border designed by Glen Andersen and Marina Szijarto and wooden benches and a basalt pillar play area designed by Sarah White.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The idea for this project came from the initial public design process for the park itself. (A group called Britiannia Neighbours formed to organize a public design process and to fundraise for the park.) During the design process there were a number of ideas related ot water, none of which turned out to be feasible. Therefore, a symbolic representation was proposed - a mosaic creek. The intent was to involve as many community members as possible in making an art project which whould symbolize the notion of contributing one's individual expression and at the same time being part of a larger whole. There was no official theme or requirements except material specifications, I.e., frost-proof tile, type of glue, and spacing of tiles for grout allowance during installation.

This installation (34 gates when completed, summer 2004) of intended diversity and uniqueness, engages the public through its accessibility and maintains an open space for lyrical discovery. By using colored glass as a kaleidoscope of sensitive hues, the seriousness of painting is removed. Each painting acquires through its intrinsic translucency a depth and vibrancy that allows the images to float.    The lobby artwork at the Carina and Callisto is made up of key components to the gates. In the Carina \"Dusk\",  inspired by water (which is 4 billion years old), and \"Rib Boat Bench\", inspired by the local boat building industry in 1900, are made out of Sitka spruce, consciously resonating with the site, physically and culturally.

The design was chosen from over 70 submissions to a public call for designs.  It took 10 years to raise the funds. After a 2-year public consultation, the Park Board approved the sight at Sunset Beach. The Society also has a mandate to educate people about AIDS. http://www.aidsmemorial.ca/",

The abacus is known to the Chinese as \"suan phan\" (counting board). It is a mechanical aid once commonly - and still sometimes - used in chinatown shops.

        ArtistProjectStatement: "turn began through an investigation of the Public Art site. It developed as a way of defining site parameters, and assessing the physical reality of creating an iconic marker for that site and the surrounding area. It was important that the work be read at a distance as well as have some aspect of the work that would be more intimate in its relationship to the viewer and the site.  The intention was to create an iconic sculpture acting as a gateway marker defining the entrance to the City of Vancouver. turn acts as an identifier of place, creating an image in the viewer�s mind that connects them back to the site. The imagery and form for turn evolved from ideas about �driving� and �fixing� in particular, with the final form of the sculpture column based upon the twist drill. The two ground elements were intended to provide a more intimate relationship to the site as well as to the scale of the viewer.",

A �nest� houses the battery and electrical components. Up to 15 bikes can be parked at the tree: 12 in the root �racks� around the base; three more can be hung from the tree trunk. The Bike Tree is sited at Science World, close to the 2010 Olympics Athletes' Village. It sits at the confluence of three major cycle paths, including the city's premiere Central Valley Greenway. The Solar Bike Tree replaces a street lamp at the end of an arc of large trees in planters, becoming one of the �trees� in effect. The round hoops of the tree�s canopy echo the spherical shape of Science World. BC Hydro funded the solar component of the piece and Webster Solar Energy was the solar consultant.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Bike racks typically don't beautify outdoor spaces, they are merely functional and are often seen to just take up space. The Solar Bike Tree turns a bike rack into a work of art, making it cool to ride and park your bike and perhaps more desirable to have a bike rack in front of businesses or in public spaces. By turning a bike rack into a sculpture, we hope to bring more attention to \"alternative transportation\" in this time of rising fuel costs and peak oil concerns. It also gives bike owners a safer, more theft and vandal-resistant way to securely park their bikes.�Spring Gillard, Garden Heart Production",

The 2� high stainless steel letters stand proud of the building�s fa�ade along narrow concrete fins that sharply turn and wrap the building�s most public corner.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "�This artwork is designed for this specific location. Working closely with the architects and the curator/organiser of the project the extension of the concrete floor plan of the building was identified as a location for a text work. Having experimented with a number of different possibilities I decided to work with a text that could work on two sides of the building � a form of call and response rather than question and answer. The work is intended as a self-conscious reflection upon the idea of development and demonstrates a simple yet evocative response to the notion of progress and achievement. Much of my work deals with the semiotics of the built world. It tries to find a contingent position in between the idea of development and urbanism. The work is both a truism and a statement of desire.�",

All aspects of the program were free, and included nutritious meals for the youth and volunteers. Britannia Community Centre graciously partnered with Young Artist Warriors on this project, and provided great storage and workspaces for these workshops to take place. 14 sessions were held in which youth were mentored to create their own large-scale works, featured in the mural. Jeska Slater painted portraits of each of the youth artists that were working to complete a large-scale piece. The portraits and the youth's original work are displayed side by side. This meant to be a celebration- both of the youth themselves, their artisitic accomplishments and their commitment to their community.",

Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place.

The convergence of these groups is protrayed in a woven design with symbols, narratives and text from each culture. The mural was conceived with input from each of the three communities, and incorporated into the final design. The mural includes many unifying elements including a large wave suggesting constancy, adaptability, humans' relationship to nature and connectivity to roots and language. Artists Eri Ishii, Richard Tetrault, Jerry Whitehead and June Yun worked with mentored youth from each cultural group on the painting of the mural.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Four paddles of Salish design, represent the four directions, and contain images of Salish serpents, and other glyph forms. The tops of the largest paddle is in flames, alluding to the great fire of Vancouver in 1886, an event that left many from the early city trapped on the shores of the Burrard Inlet. Indians of the Coast Salish Squamish arrived in their dugout canoes to rescue people, sheltering them in their nearby village church. The poem that was sung as they paddled the inlet is inscribed on the bow of the canoe. The movement of the paddles is echoed in vertical bamboo along the left side, superimposed with the Hanji character meaning 'Harmony\" and aims to emphasize the collaborative nature of this project as well as the unique characteristic of the Downtown Eastside where several cultures co-exist in harmony.",

Functioning as a sign on the building, the letters are rendered in a font designed by the artists which references the motif of a formal trellis structure employing trompe l'oeil techniques to create illusory depth and space. The spacing between the words in the phrase is based on a section of a Fibonacci sequence - reinforcing notions of the ideal, perfection and pragmatism which Voltaire explored so richly in Candide.",

Musqueam elders advised that the small juvenile tree planted in the center should be the highly revered western red cedar. Over the years, as the fungi breaks down the stacked wood recycling it into humus, the red cedar will flourish into a beautiful tree while the stone slabs (�petals�) will slowly open up like a flower.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "Like Booth�s other wood and stone works such as Tranekaer Vader, 1998 and Zunderschwamm, 1999   nac???t??p �Transformation Plant� harnesses the great recycling ability of fungi to facilitate a very long term (30 +/- years) kinetic living earth art work.In doing these living works, it is one of the artist�s aims to highlight the wonders of fungi, the most extensive of all living organisms and one of our most ancient sources of food and medicine.  This ancient and generally lesser known plant-like organism is vital to all life on earth, yet is threatened by human activities.  The uncontrolled build-up of manmade greenhouse gas emissions is making our atmosphere inhospitable ? even toxic ? to life as we know it. The devastation caused by people is happening around us on an ever-increasing scale. Hopefully, these living earth art works will educate the visitor to be wiser � to become proactive in reversing this spiraling catastrophe.",

The artwork title �RGB� refers to the additive model of reproducing colours with light (red, green, and blue). The three colours can also be seen to symbolize the Trinity. A fritted glass pattern comprised of over 1,000 crosses on each large panel of glass are repeated across the windows of the church facility. Nine different intuitive arrangements of crosses, three arrangements for each of the three colours, create an overall, organic, swarming pattern. The architecture appears porous as light passes through the windows and the shadows of the crosses spill across the interior surfaces.",
        ArtistProjectStatement: "The simple unadorned cross was chosen to create a pattern in order to de-emphasize its form. With over one thousand crosses on each large panel of glass and approximately two hundred thousand crosses that cover the windows of the CPC, each individual cross becomes the building block or pixels that creates a larger whole. Along with the intuitive arrangements of the crosses, which create a contrast to the rigid grid of the building, these organic swarms of crosses seek to visually erode the architecture making it more porous, almost formless, allowing for a gentler interface with its surroundings.Similar to ambient music, with an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over structure and rhythm, �RGB� seeks to reflect the diversity and inclusiveness of the Central Presbyterian Church and the surrounding West End community.",

It connects us to Vancouver's maritime environment by visualizing the twice-daily rise and fall of the local tide. A glowing white light glides up and down the \"scale\" of the tower, backed in green light as the tide goes out (ebb), then changing to blue as it comes in (flow). As the tide shifts, the faint trail of white light tells you if it is rising or falling. Each two floors of the building represent roughly one foot of tide height.",

A glacial boulder was selected from the earth at the project site, and six replica �boulders� were cast from aluminum. WHERENESS provides a tactile link and landmark between the area�s geological past and its current situation. It is a visual puzzle to be examined and contemplated �in the round.� WHERENESS acknowledges an ancient human practice of piling rocks at certain points along pathways to guide travelers. This 20� tall column of boulders creates a new �point along the way� for an emerging neighbourhood on the Cambie corridor in Vancouver.",

        ArtistProjectStatement: "Our vision for this public art project focused on the idea that 'playtime\" is itself a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary. Our goal was to develop a collection of works that the children, families, staff and general public could play with as part of the Wellness Walkway. Playtime encourages a more physical engagement with the work than is normally allowed with public art and was the core concept in the development of these works. Our hope is that what we have proposed will engage everybody through their tactile qualities and lift the spirits with their humour and playfulness.",
