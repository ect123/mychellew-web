GEOB 472: Lab 1 – Textile Waste Recycling Depots

Here is a screenshot of what my map is mean to do. I thought that this part of my map was the most 
interesting because it is a snapshot of what I intended this map to be. A simple, user-friendly way to 
identify where donation boxes or other textile waste drop off locations are. 
The intended audience of this map was the general public. As there are varying levels of familiarity with 
technology, with my current skills and taking into account the diverse user demographic. I limited the 
functionality of this map to ensure that information was conveyed in a simple to understand way. In a 
project that I conducted last year surrounding textile waste in Metro Vancouver. It was apparent that 
there was a lack of a centralized information source that took into account locations of commercial 
recyclers of textile waste, thrift shops, recycling centers and donation bins owned and operated by 
different charities that reside in the Metro Vancouver area. As mentioned before, I took into account 
the diverse user demographic that would use this map as a tool to identify the closest recycling “depot” 
to where they are. Simple circle point symbols were used to classify the different types of recycling 
depot s there were. The depots were roughly classified into Charity, Second hand, Thrift Shop, Retail, 
Social Services, Recycling Facility. Charity are essentially non-profit organizations that take in textile 
clothes/textile waste for charitable purposes such as Big Brothers. Second Hand and Thrift Shop depots  
overlap in terms of characteristics as there was as they were categorized differently. A group member 
and I had unknowingly labelled these depots differently and did not have the time to review 457 data 
points that we had manually collected. These are essentially the same, examples include The Salvation 
Army. Consignments are like thrift stores but cater to those who are looking for branded name clothing. 
Recycling Centers are locations where the old textile waste is repurposed into new fabric and Retail 
depots refer to clothing stores that accept old clothing.
I believe that my map, despite its simplicity did send the message that I was hoping too. The base map 
was chosen as it similar to what one would see when they use Google Maps. When the users zoom they 
are able to see landmarks, or store fronts that they may be familiar with in the area to orient 
themselves. In addition, categorized the symbols with a larger size (they were also the same size as 
there is no apparent hierarchy to the data that was used) and based on their recycling type with bright 
colors to ensure that those could differentiate between the different categorizes and to allow users who 
may have a harder time seeing be able to interact with the map. Though I do recognize that this may not 
be inclusive to users who may be blind or colorblind. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a legend as the 
code did not work when I uploaded the html file. If I were to continue to work on this map, I would 
ensure a legend, review the data that was collected last year to ensure accuracy, if it was up today, and 
to recategorize some of the depot locations and add descriptions. I would also like to add in a 
functionality where people could type in their address and have the map move their location to improve 
the user experience. I also considered creating a 2 km radius around the points, however, I didn’t know 
the scale of the map and was unable to do so.
