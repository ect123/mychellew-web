Lab 3 Reflection:

Originally, I had worked on a project through Unity with the aim to create a location game (using Mapbox SDK) - similar to Pokemon Go used to educate UBC's peer program student leaders about the wellness, professional development resources (they would catch animals as they walked on campus and they would have to collect different types of resources to be able to share with their peers) on campus for when they would roam around campus for their training sessions in September and March. The game was in the process of being created through following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhG1kfDBhgM" target="blank"></a>, speaking with peers, reviewing help fourms and with the help of a friend who had experience in Unity and videogame design. However, due to technical difficulties the project was stopped.

For this new project, I was inspired by this tutorial through A-frame's tutorial

Due time constraints, the conceptualization of this project is limited in its scope.
